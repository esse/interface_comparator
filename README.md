## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'interface_comparator'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install interface_comparator

## Usage

```ruby
require 'interface_comparator'
# check if two objects has the same interface
# including public methods list and their arity
InterfaceComparator.same?(a, b) # => true or false

# see detailed list of difference between interfaces
# of two objects
InterfaceComparator.diff_interfaces(a, b)
# if there are difference between methods
# it will return them in aa array of hashes:
#[{
#    method: :new_method,
#    first_object: true,
#    second_object: false
#}]
#
# if there are not difference between methods
# but there are differences in arity of them
# it will return them in an array of hashes:
#[{
#    method: :new_method,
#    first_object_arity: 1,
#    second_object_arity: 0
#}]
```

## Usage with minitest

If you want to use it with minitest, please require helper:
```ruby
require 'interface_comparator/minitest'
```

Library will provide you with two new assertions:
```ruby
assert_equal_interfaces a, b
refute_equal_interfaces a, b
```

Output in case of failure will be similar to those in diff_interfaces.
